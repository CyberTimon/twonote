# TwoNote - A Simple OneNote Clone
Welcome to TwoNote, a simple and intuitive note-taking application inspired by OneNote, designed to keep your notes organized and easily accessible. Our application is built using Flask for the backend and plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, ensuring a lightweight and efficient experience.

### Why another OneNote clone?

My friends and I were in search of a straightforward note-sharing platform that didn't require a complex login procedure. Aiming for maximum simplicity, I developed this application in an afternoon. Please note, the entire interface is in German, but you're welcome to translate it into English.
